Implementing the "save courses" functionality, we'll need to:

Create a many-to-many relationship between users and courses so that a user can save multiple courses
and a course can be saved by multiple users.
I created a new table in models.py to handle many-to-many relationship (SavedCourses)


Add a "Save" button to the course listings so that users can save courses.

Create a page/tab where users can view their saved courses
