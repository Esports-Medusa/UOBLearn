Implementing the "save courses" functionality, we'll need to:

Create a many-to-many relationship between users and courses so that a user can save multiple courses
and a course can be saved by multiple users.
I created a new table in models.py to handle many-to-many relationship (SavedCourses)
the user and course models were updated to create a relationship

Add a "Save" button to the course listings so that users can save courses.
First step was to create a route to save a course.
To save a course the user must be logged into the system and this view handler checks the
course exists and has not been previously saved by the user.

Then I added another route to handle the display of all courses saved by the user.

Create a page/tab where users can view their saved courses
